Enroll a patient in a protocol via the OpenLoop Health Partners API. This creates a protocol enrollment that automatically manages the underlying program enrollments.

**Required Fields:**

- `stripe_product_id` - Stripe product ID for the protocol

**How It Works:**
1. Patient is enrolled in the specified protocol
2. System automatically creates individual program enrollments based on the protocol's program associations
3. Returns protocol enrollment details and count of program enrollments created

**Benefits:**
- Simplified enrollment process
- Automatic program enrollment management
- Consistent billing and status tracking
